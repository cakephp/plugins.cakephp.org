h1. CakePackages !https://travis-ci.org/cakephp/cakepackages.png?branch=master!:https://travis-ci.org/cakephp/cakepackages

A self-contained application that tracks CakePHP developer's open source code repositories, including applications and plugins. Includes some social integration features

h2. Background

After constantly searching for CakePHP code, I realized a lot of it existed on Github. And, in fact, the core code is now on GitHub. So it seemed natural to create a site to index all this code.

Since I was unemployed/bored/miserable/drunk, I decided to focus all my energy on creating just such a thing. That was over a year ago (March 1st seems to be my first commit, although I know I was working on it before then...), and the codebase has been through at least two redesigns and countless code iterations. I've learned a thing or two in the process, and have even gotten a job as a result of it.

This is apparently now an official project. However, because there are other official projects, this is still mostly a one-man show, so feel free to contribute back to the codebase through code, design, and feedback.

h2. Requirements

* PHP 5.3+ .
* CakePHP 2.2+
* GIT for version control
* "God":https://github.com/mojombo/god for running DJJob in the background on a server

h2. Installation

_[Manual]_

# Download this: http://github.com/cakephp/cakepackages/zipball/master
# Unzip that download.
# Copy the resulting folder to a new directory containing the cake core

_[GIT Clone]_

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/cakephp/cakepackages.git cakepackages</code></pre>

If using git clone to download be sure to update the submodules after you clone with the command:

<pre><code>cd cakepackages && git submodule update --init</code></pre>

h2. Usage

You'll want to run the migrations for both cakepackages and the plugins. I've also included a schema.php file. SQL Dump with dummy data to come.

h2. Todo

* Documentation
* -Set Default retry on CakeDjjob to be at least 1, so adding new packages/maintainers doesn't fail randomly-
* Increase visibility across the web through social integration
** Integrate with GitHub's OAuth implementation for user accounts
* Push user accounts and a user dashboard
** Possible dashboard aggregating both code and community resources useful to that person?
* Integrate a "risingcake.com":risingcake.com like news dashboard
* -Fix RSS Sanitization such that characters that should be escaped are escaped properly-
* Integrate a project's readme
* More robust application/plugin distinction, as well as checking both standards and to see if something that should be a plugin is
* Full Plugin Installer API. Docs to come
* -Allow users to submit new packages for inclusion in the index-
** Possible DDOS issue? (Should be handled at the server-level)
* -More robust filtering-
** -May need to look into alternative searching systems, such as ElasticSearch or Sphinx- (punting on this till later)
** Allow filtering by maintainer?
*** -For now just appended Maintainer.username to like query-
* -Allow rating/commenting on packages- (liking/bookmarking are better than rating)
* Allow users to submit tags for a package
* -Fix issue where packages that should be disabled are passing that check-
* -Add support for organizations-
* Add support for -CodaSet-/Google Code/SourceForge/BitBucket/OTHER_NAME_HERE
* Unit tests
* -Minify assets for new design-
* -Add shell tasks to cron where necessary-
* -Update maintainer/package views-
* Infinite pagination of packages
** BackboneJS?
* -Remove csf theme submodule- (re-added, made it more subtle)
** -Better deployment strategy for dealing with official CSF dependencies- easy-squeezy
